# lab-template
A template for encouraging the use of R Markdown for writing lab reports.

The template includes a simple Rmd file, one image and a csv file. The template can be used to generate the same report in HTML, PDF and MS Word formats. The MS Word output, however, shows that multiline title does not work properly.

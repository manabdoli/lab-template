# lab-template
This is an attempt to encourage students to use R Markdown for writing their lab reports.

Main files are:

- `R/lab01-howRMDworks.Rmd` that shows what is needed for Rmd to work and, at the same time, shows some of R Markdown capabilities.
- `R/lab-template.Rmd` that proposes a structure for lab reports in an introductory statistics course.


## Notes
- The MS Word version of the document shows that the multiple line *title* setup in YAML section of `R/lab01-howRMDworks.Rmd` is not working properly; so if a MS Word format is needed, it is recommended that a single line *title* is used.

- The capabilities of R Markdown can be extended by installing `bookdown` package. See [bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org/) for more information.

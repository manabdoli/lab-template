# lab-template
This is an attempt to encourage students to use R Markdown for writing their lab reports.

Main files are:

- `R/lab01-howRMDworks.Rmd` that shows what is needed for Rmd to work and, at the same time, shows some of R Markdown capabilities.
- `R/lab-template.Rmd` that proposes a structure for lab reports in an introductory statistics course.
